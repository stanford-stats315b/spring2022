## Submission guidelines

Homeworks must be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date. You are allowed 3 LATE DAYs throughout the entire quarter, as further detailed below.  All homeworks should be submitted via [Gradescope](TODO). You will receive an invite to Gradescope for STATS315B Spring 2022. If you have not received an invite email after the first few days of class, first log in to Gradescope with your @stanford.edu email and see whether you find the course listed; if not, please post a private message on Ed for us to add you. 

## Honor code and collaboration policy

We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. Each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by themself.  Additionally, each student must write their own code in the programming part of the assignment.  When working in study groups, you must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated. 

For concept quizzes, these are to be completed completely on your own without discussion.

It is an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo. We run plagiarism-detection software on your code against past solutions as well as student submissions from current and previous years. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the Stanford Honor Code.

In summary, we expect students to want to learn and not Google for answers or copy those of other students. The purpose of assignments and concept quizzes in this course is to help you think about the material, not just give us the right answers.  Please ask us if you are unsure about the use of a particular reference.

## Regrade policy

If you feel that we have made an error in grading your homework assignment or concept quiz, please wait 24 hours before submitting a regrade request after grading has been published. Subsequently, submit a regrade request via [Gradescope](TODO), including a detailed written explanation, within one week of grades being published. Please note that regrading of the work may cause your grade to go up or down. 

## Late assignment policy

Every student is allotted 3 free LATE DAYs throughout the entire quarter, which may be used on homework assignments, the project proposal, or project milestone. (Late days cannot be used for the final project report or poster due to grading constraints.)

After these late days are exhausted, late assignments will incur a reduction of 33% in the final score for each day (or part thereof) it is late. For example, if an assignment is up to 24 hours late, it incurs a penalty of 33%. Else if it is up to 48 hours late, it incurs a penalty of 66%. And if it is 72 or more hours late, it will receive no credit.

You must turn in all homework assignments, even if for zero credit, in order to pass the course.
