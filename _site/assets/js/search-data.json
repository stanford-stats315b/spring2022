Students entering the course are assumed to have foundational working knowledge in statistics, probability, and basic machine learning concepts, though the course has been designed to provide a broadly accessible treatment of the topics covered. The course starts with a quick review of linear regression and classification, error metrics, and the bias-variance tradeoff. We then delve into decision trees and deep learning techniques for non-linear regression and classification tasks. The subsequent modules move beyond regression and classification tasks and turn to discovering patterns and low-dimensional structure via unsupervised learning. Topics include clustering, dimensionality reduction and autoencoding methods, and matrix factorization. The last module considers time series and sequential data sources via state space models and deep learning methods. ",

However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. Each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by themself. Additionally, each student must write their own code in the programming part of the assignment. When working in study groups, you must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated. For concept quizzes, these are to be completed completely on your own without discussion. It is an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo. We run plagiarism-detection software on your code against past solutions as well as student submissions from current and previous years. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the Stanford Honor Code. In summary, we expect students to want to learn and not Google for answers or copy those of other students. The purpose of assignments and concept quizzes in this course is to help you think about the material, not just give us the right answers.
