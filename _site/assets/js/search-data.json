Students entering the course are assumed to have foundational working knowledge in statistics, probability, and basic machine learning concepts, though the course has been designed to provide a broadly accessible treatment of the topics covered. The course starts with a quick review of linear regression and classification, error metrics, and the bias-variance tradeoff. We then delve into decision trees and deep learning techniques for non-linear regression and classification tasks. The subsequent modules move beyond regression and classification tasks and turn to discovering patterns and low-dimensional structure via unsupervised learning. Topics include clustering, dimensionality reduction and autoencoding methods, and matrix factorization. The last module considers time series and sequential data sources via state space models and deep learning methods. ",

    "content": "Your grade is based on two activities: . | Paper reviews and discussion (20%) | Projects (2 x 40% = 80%) | . 1. Paper reviews and discussions . Paper reviews. Before each class, you will be assigned 1-2 papers. You should read these papers carefully and write a review of the paper(s). Your review should be a few paragraphs (in the style of a conference review, say for ACL or NeurIPS). Paper reviews are due at 11:00 AM PST on Gradescope on the day of the lecture. Paper discussions. During each class discussion, there is a panel of 4-5 students (you are expected to sign up for at least two panels). The student panelists lead a discussion moderated by the instructors. Everyone else is expected to participate by asking the panel questions. 2. Projects . There are two projects, which allow you to get hands-on experience with large language models. | Project 1 is on evaluating language models. You will be provided with access to models such as GPT-3 and asked to think critically about their capabilities and risks. You will identify a focal property of language models that you’d like to explore more deeply. | Project 2 is on building language models. You will be provided with a compute budget that will allow you to train models such as BERT-base to more systematically evaluate, understand, and improve language models along the focal property you identified in project 1. | . Projects should be done in groups of 1-2 students. Each project should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your writing is unclear or unnecessarily complicated. Projects must be typeset using LaTeX, Microsoft Word, Pages for Mac, or an equivalent program, and submitted as a PDF. We strongly encourage you to use LaTeX: there are user-friendly web interfaces like Overleaf. Projects are due at 11:00 PM (not 11:59 PM) PST on Gradescope on the due date. Submitting coursework . Submissions: All coursework are submitted via Gradescope by the deadline. Do not submit your coursework via email. If anything goes wrong, please ask a question on Ed or contact a course assistant. If you need to sign up for a Gradescope account, please use your @stanford.edu email address. You can submit as many times as you’d like until the deadline: we will only grade the last submission. Partial work is better than not submitting any work. If you are working in a group for a homework, please make sure all group members are selected as part of the submission on Gradescope. Late days: A homework is ⌈d⌉ days late if it is turned in d days past the due date (note that this means if you are 1 second late, ⌈d⌉=1 and it is 1 day late). You have 3 late days in total that can be distributed among the homeworks without penalty. After that, the maximum possible grade is decreased by 25% each day (so the best you can do with d=1 is 75%; paper reviews will be graded as fails if they are late and you have no late days). As an example, if you are out of late days and submit one day late, a 90 will be capped at a 75, but a 72 will not be changed. Note that we will only allow a max of d=2 late days per homework. Regrades: If you believe that the course staff made an objective error in grading, then you may submit a regrade request. Regrade requests will only be accepted via Gradescope for one week after the initial grades were released. Note that we may regrade your entire submission, so that depending on your submission you may actually lose more points than you gain. ",
